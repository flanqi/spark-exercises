Overall MAPE: 152.38748425018215
MAPE for Violent Crimes: 177.4966722095173
MAPE for non-Violent Crimes: 150.29956869884984

[Side Notes]
I consider a beat at a given week is a beat of violent crimes if above half of its crime cases are arrested.

Above are the MAPE(%) results when I use external dataset. However, if I drop the feature extracted from the external dataset, the performance is actually better, with about 30% MAPE for three all categories. 

But here I am only submitting the metrics I got when incorporating the external dataset for grading purpose.
