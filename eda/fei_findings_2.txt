Part 1
See fei_2_1.txt for the top 10 list.

Part 2
Based on the output file fei_2_2.txt and the map, the two adjacent beats with the highest correlation are (0714, 0825) (Note that two beats are not considered adjacent if they only touch on one point).

Part 3
In this question, a 2-sample t-test with unequal variance is performed on the yearly number of crimes for the two mayors. The t-statistics printed during code execution is -9.252849094723437.
